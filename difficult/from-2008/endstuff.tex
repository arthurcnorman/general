\chapter{Conclusions}

Regardless of whether my suggestions here could turn into a series of
master-classes does anybody have the stamina and energy to turn my list
of suggestions 1-17 above into 17 chapters in a book on introductory and
somewhat recreational computer science with me? My bet is that if I tried
on my own I would stall, but surely each chapter above would easily turn
into 5-10 pages (let's say 6 pages of words and 4 of pictures and
listings and sample output) which adds up to 170 pages and a length that
would not feel too silly?
