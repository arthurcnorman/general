\chapter{Primitive Recursion}
\begin{quotation}\textit{
Turing machines etc are HORRID because you can not solve the
halting problem, and that means in effect that formal justification
of stuff is too hard.
So is there a model of computation that is powerful enough to be
useful, straightfoward enough to leave at least some prospect for
analysis b ut that is tame enough that the biggest blockages of
Turing machines are not included.
Step forward ``primitive recursion''. Its key features are
that any computation expressed using it is guaranteed to terminate
(possibly after a time so long that you will have given up waiting),
And it can express a remarkable proportion of the problems you might
set a computer.
