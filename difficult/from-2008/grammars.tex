\chapter{Phrase-structure grammars}
Continuing in the same vein we can have
\begin{verbatim}
   sentence ::= subject verb object
\end{verbatim}

and the like as an introduction to context-free grammars. But issues of
{\em is it context free?}, {\em is it ambiguous?} and {\em does it
generate all but only all the sentences we wanted?} arise. We get a
chance to mention terminal and non-terminal symbols and precedence.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Here is a baby grammar, is it ambiguous?
\item Create a grammar to exactly characterise the following...
\item Create a grammar that informally and approximately models the
following real worldish situation
\item Start work on a grammar that describes your favourite computer language  
\end{enumerate}
