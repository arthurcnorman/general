\chapter{Analog aspects of digital electronics}
A different sort of simulation would be needed here, or even access to
real breadboards. But a point to stress is that Maplin's one-off prices
(easy to buy if not the cheapest) put nand gates and inverters at pence
per gate, so experimentation is not an expensive hobby!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Making 3 inverters into a ring oscillator
\item Race conditions
\item Hazards
\item Slowly changing inputs, and making a schmitt trigger using a bit
of positive feedback, thereby making things safe and debounced
\item Cross-talk from a driven line into a gate input that is left
open circuit?
\item Whatever else some hardware people like to propose.  
\end{enumerate}
