\chapter{(metafont) The formation of characters}
This is something I am not really familiar with, but we could
unquestionably find a suitable expert! The fact that the shape of a
letter {\em g} differs from {\bf g} and that there are ways of
describing it must provide plenty of scope for fun.

\item I am not going to plan exercises to go with this, but I am
confident that there are plenty of opportunities and that the topic can
transform people's view of what Computer Science concerns itself with.
And while it is ``graphic'' it sends a message different from the
``computing is about video games'' one. It also gives a chance to chant the
name {\em Knuth}.
\end{enumerate}
