\chapter{Intractable problems}
\begin{quotation}\textit{
The chapter about galactic algorithms looked at extraordinarily
laborious ways of solving problems, but various of the problems
considered could be resolved in sensible amounts of time in practical-sized
cases using an alternative method which would lose out to the galactic
algorithm in the long run, but only the very very very long run. This
chapter considers problems where in some cases all we can say is that the
current best solution known is obnoxiously time consuming and in others
where it is possible to prove that an algorithm, including all the ones
not yet invented, will be infeasibly slow.
