\chapter{Lisp (Scheme)}
Ages and ages ago I prepared a range of illustrations of how Lisp (at
that time on the BBC micro) could be used to model small versions of a
range of applications, including

\begin{enumerate}
\item text adventure dungeon
\item tiny mini-compiler
\item evaluation of expressions
\item tree-sort
\item bignum arithmetic, e.g. with the number a million represented as
the list (0 0 0 0 0 0 1) with the least significant digit first.
\item an {\em animal guessing game}
\item route-finding 
\end{enumerate}
