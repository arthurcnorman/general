This stuff dates for 2008! That will mean that some of it is out of date
and also various bits are not immediately relevant. But it may also be full
of pointers to stuff that is not instantly obvious to those who have not been
there before.

Another term that was used in "the old days" was the concept of a "Rainy Day
Book". That is a work full of tolerably small projects, so if it is raining
and you are bored you can open it up and find something to work on.
I tend to believe that most computing things make most sense when one
actually codes them. The pain of banging your head against the bugs is
a very special part of the delight!
