\chapter{Iterated Functions}
I do not have the exact agenda for this topic worked out, but if I list a
bunch of things that fall under the general heading, or technology we
understand that it relates to I hope you can see that there is scope for
it turning into a nice day with both exposition and practical work. It
may be that the spread of ideas I have bundled together here mean it is
really two or more topics!

\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(2n) \rightarrow n, f(n) \rightarrow 3n+1$. What is the trajectory
of the sequence of iterates of f starting at various starting points
$k=1,2,\ldots$?
\item The logistic map $x \rightarrow \lambda x(1-x)$ for various values of
the parameter $\lambda$ and perhaps various starting values of x. This is
all to do with the onset of chaos and cries out for practical work! And it
is so much less technically messy than the Mandelbrot set and so much
more really keyed into academic empirical study, as in what is the sequence
of critical values for $\lambda$ where the behaviour changes\ldots
\item numerical iterations, and can you predict the value that they converge
to? Newton Raphson to compute square roots and reciprocals etc.
\item We also know about the relationship between primitive recursive
functions and recursive functions (the latter being iterations of the former
subject to a minimisation operator) and we know about the Y operator that
iterates a function.
\item Find a function $f$ such that $f(f(x)) = x^2-2$.
\end{enumerate}
