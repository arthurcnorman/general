\chapter{String re-writing}
This starts with a world that is close to that of the cellular automata
mentioned earlier. Your formalism is a set of rewrites such as
\begin{verbatim}
    abaa -> axba
    xxx -> ya
\end{verbatim}
etc., where the re-writes are just of strings of characters, they may not
preserve the length of the overall string and you keep applying them for
so long as one of the left hand sides of a rule is present as a
sub-string of your initial input. Key ideas are universal capability,
non-determinacy and confluence and Knuth-Bendix style completion.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the consequence of these rewrites?
\item Create a set of rewrites to achieve this effect
\item Is the following set of rewrites confluent?
\item Extent these to make them confluent
\end{enumerate}
