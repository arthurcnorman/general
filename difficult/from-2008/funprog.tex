\chapter{Functional Programming}
ML is already a notably small language, but one could cut it down yet
further so the only utterances available were
\begin{verbatim}
    fun f 0 = value      fun f nil = value
    fun f n = ...n...    fun f (a::b) = ...a...b...
\end{verbatim}
plus multi-argument variants. All function definitions are global so you
have no scope issues at all. So this is really just recursive functions!
Via currying, map and a few more bits of cleverness I can start to write
worthwhile but mind-bending programs using no more syntax than that! And
providing infrastructure that could do just that is close to trivial.

\begin{enumerate}
\item append, reverse
\item Use of map, filter, fold
\item Check Larry's ML tickable problems and ones from earlier
generations of the course to find further exercises --- there are plenty of
opportunities! Including ones that will burn out the brains of the
smartest customers!
\end{enumerate}
