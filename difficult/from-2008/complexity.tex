\chapter{How the Clique problem and Hamiltonian Circuit problems are
related}
Complexity is all about transforming instances of problem A into
instances of problem B, and very often both problems are easy to explain,
often at least one will involve graphs (with vertices and edges) and
often the transformation will be bob-obvious but easy once explained.
This may make it a natural area for gee-whizz in the presentation and
lead to scope for puzzling exercises finding or applying transformations.
The fact that that in the end we are interested in polynomially bounded
transformations does not need stressing.
