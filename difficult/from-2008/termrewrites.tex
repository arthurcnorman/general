\chapter{Term-rewrites for Algebra}
First try $D(x+y) \rightarrow Dx+Dy$ etc to describe differentiation and
try to build on that to see how well you can simplify the result of
(for instance) $DDDDD(1/x)$.

Then try $q^{2} \rightarrow 2$ and wonder if it gives you a way to
computer with the square root of 2. If you assume you have polynomial
simplification and introduce rewrites like this then with one simple
rewrite life is easy. With two (for univariate polynomials) the key
result is that you end up as if you have found the GDD of those two
rewrites, while for more than 2 you need Groebner bases.
