\chapter{Mathematical logic and Hardware logic}
Via simulators it should be feasible to do some digital electronics.
Showing the linke between logic in the mathematical sense and the gates
used in computers could represent fun. I am going to suggest that a first
session concentrates solely on pure logic (i.e. No flip-flops or other
``state'').

\begin{enumerate}
\item Gate minimisation via Karnaugh maps
\item Conversion of a 4-wire representation on 0-9 to drivers for a
7-seg display
\item Binary numbers and a half-adder
\item Ripple carry in an adder
\item Fast look-ahead carry blocks
\end{enumerate}
